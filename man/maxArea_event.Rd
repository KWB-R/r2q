must fit to Ci_river and Ci_storm.}

must fit to Ci_threshold and Ci_river.}

\description{
Calculate connectable area to a river based on pollutant input within a
heavy rain event
}
\details{
The catchment_area is used as initial value for the optimisation algorithm.
The default 100 ha should be sufficient for most problems. In that case
the optimal solution between 0 and 1 000 kmÂ²
