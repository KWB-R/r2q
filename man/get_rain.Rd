\usage{
get_rain(
  area_catch,
  river_cross_section,
  river_length,
  x_coordinate,
  y_coordinate,
  Hq_pnat1_catch = NULL,
  slope = 0.1,
  use_p1nat = TRUE,
  river_flow = NULL,
  mins = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{area_catch}{The catchment area in km2}

\item{river_cross_section}{The average river cross section in the catchment
in m2}

\item{river_length}{The length of the affected urban river stretch in m}

\item{x_coordinate, y_coordinate}{coordinates in ETRS89.
See Datails for more information.}

\item{Hq_pnat1_catch}{the natural catchment discharge for a yearly rain event
in L/(s*km2). If NULL it will be estimated by slope and area of the catchment}

\item{slope}{Average slope of the catchment in \% (Default is 0.1)}

\item{use_p1nat}{If TRUE, the natural catchment discharge is used
(see get_Hq1_pnat) is used to define the precipitation duration. If FALSE
the average river flow is used. Exception: If mins is defined, this value is
used.}

\item{river_flow}{The average river flow in mÂ³/s (only needed if use_p1nat
= FALSE and min = NULL)}

\item{mins}{The Default is NULL. In this case either natural catchment
discharge or average river flow is used for precipitation duration. If not
Null, mins is used and overwrites the parameter "use_p1nat".}
}
\value{
A Vector with the calculated duration of precipitation in minutes and the
rain event based on KOSTRA in L/(s*ha)
}
\description{
The rate of the yearly rain event depends on the prescribed duration. In this
function the duration is either calculated using the natural catchment
discharge, using the average river flow or entered manualle.
}
\details{
The KOSTRA Data is available for a grid of x x x km. The location
is given in coordinates in the ETRS89 system
(For information see: https://epsg.io/3034)
Longitudes and Lattidudes in WGS84 can be converted into ETRS89 here:
